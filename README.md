This project was first created in 2019 as a part of an Android Application (unofficial app for a comedy competition TV Show). This project was integrated into the app and allowed users to vote for the elected candidates.

It was first built on Angular V8 and later upgraded to the latest (as of 2022) Angular V14 version.
The project uses the magic of Firebase Firestore to show/cast votes in realtime across all connected users.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
